"Welcome to AHME. Here in the Artificial Happiness Maintenance Environment, we will keep track of happy memories to improve your mood. Whenever you have a happy experience, write a short log of it in the text box, and then it will be locally stored to your individual environment. Within your view environment, logs can be searched for, edited, and deleted for your convenience. Please enjoy the Artificial Happiness Maintenance Environment, and we hope to hear from you soon."   -- _Disembodied Voice_

This app was a small personal project for me to get familiar with React Native, Typescript, and JSX. I worked on this project over the summer between high school and college, and I had a lot of fun with it! It's not everything I envisioned (there's still stuff I might want to add) but I learned a lot about web design, data management, and project release. I might not continue this project since I have a more ambitious React Native project that I want to work on during my Freshman year. Thanks for reading this and have a great day!

### if you'd like to try it for yourself
