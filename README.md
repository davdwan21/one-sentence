This app was a small personal project for me to get familiar with React Native, Typescript, and JSX. I worked on this project over the summer between high school and college, and I had a lot of fun with it! It's not everything I envisioned (there's still stuff I want to add) but I learned a lot about web design, data management, and project release. I might not continue this project since I have a more ambitious React Native project that I want to work on during my Freshman year. Thanks for reading this and have a great day!
